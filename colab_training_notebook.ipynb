# ðŸŽ¯ AutoPatternChecker Model Training Notebook

This notebook demonstrates how to train and fine-tune models in AutoPatternChecker for better performance on your specific data.

## What You'll Learn:
1. **Clustering Model Training** - Optimize HDBSCAN and KMeans parameters
2. **Embedding Model Fine-tuning** - Improve semantic similarity detection  
3. **Normalization Model Training** - Learn better text cleaning rules
4. **Model Evaluation** - Measure performance improvements
5. **Production Deployment** - Use trained models in your API

## Prerequisites:
- Your CSV data file
- Google Drive mounted (for saving models)
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts## Step 1: Setup and Install Dependencies# ðŸŽ¯ AutoPatternChecker Model Training Notebook
